for those who are struggling with
Attempted import error: 'Switch' is not exported from 'react-router-dom'.

1). Uninstall Previous Version-
npm uninstall react-router-dom
2). Install Older version-
npm install react-router-dom@5.2.0

because after v6 switch is not included in react-router-dom 

another solution is :-
for new version of react-router-dom


Instead of using like this

      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/">
          <Home />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/users">
          <Users />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
Use like this...

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="users/*" element={<Users />} />
      </Routes>
